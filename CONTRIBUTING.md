Do u want to contribute to SternalBoard?

SternalBoard was mainly builded on Java8, ill deny any PR built on J9+ Use JetBRAINS notes.

It is required that all pr follow this format, 
since this repository works in this way and so we can
communicate in the same language without creating confusion.

**It is very important that you take into account that if you do 
not follow the indications in this section, your prerequisites will not be taken into account.**

We use a format in commits similar if not 
almost the same as Angular, please check it and apply it. [Here](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines)

Be brief, concise and precise, we do not want to know the history of what you want to contribute but an explanation of the contribution in terms of its function.

Avoid using jokes or meaningless phrases for commits, remember that this is an area where you are the one who looks bad.

```
